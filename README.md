# Social-media-app

Work in progress, backend is done, it connects with a mongodb database to store users and posts, front end needs post feed done, 
widgets done, and friends done, so far only nav-bar is done, dark and light mode is done, and login/registration/authentication is done. 


To run the website, you will have to have yarn or npm, I prefer yarn but I use both depending on day of the week. 
In the console first start the server by cd your console into the server folder and if you already have npm installed use do 
(nodemon index.js) and that should start the backend server. 

After cd another cmd into the clientv2 folder and do 'yarn start' if you have the dependencies installed otherwise you will need to install all the dependencies using your preffered package manager and run the code. 

Then you should be able to mess around with it, the website is also made to be mobile compatible but that hasnt been tested much. 

Maybe one day I shall deploy the app after I finish it. I hope you enjoy the quality of work!
